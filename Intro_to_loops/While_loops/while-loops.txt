If statment run for single time for sigle line,
while statment run for continuously till condition meets.

Ex.
counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print("something")
    counter +=1

OutPUT:-
something
something
something

counter vars is 0
counter +=1 -- it add 1 in vars counter at each iteration/flow/loops.

while counter < 3:
if counter vars value 0 t0 2 not meets it runt iteration till meet to counter vars value is 2
and print string "something" till meets this conditions.

If we use if statment for this loops

counter = 0

if counter < 3:
    print("something")

This will print string "something" for sigle time.
