Dictionary is a data type which use for to store a coollection of value list, map.

How to create a Dictionary ?

Use var_name = {"key": "value"}  . Under { } is called Dictionary
The Dictionary {"key": "value"} is assigned to var_name

Ex.
consoles = {"nintendo": "wii"}

If you have multiple Key & value for single/same vars. seperate each dictionory by ",".

consoles = {"nintendo": "wii", "microsoft": "xbox", "sony": "playstation"}


I want to get value of any specific dictionary from this lists. like "microsoft"

print(var_name["dictionary's key_name"])
print(console["microsoft"])
# OutPut:- xbox

Assign a output to new vars.
print(consoles["microsoft"])
# OutPut:- xbox

val = consoles["microsoft"]
print(val)

# OutPut:- xbox

print("The " + consoles["sony"] + " 4 is Sony's newest gaming console.")
# OutPut:- The playstation 4 is Sony's newest gaming console.


KEY VALUES
Keys values can be Int, floats, or Both Int, floats, and Boolean.

# you can use diff data types with diff keys in same dictionary.

hardness = {9: "corundum", 10: "dimond"}
floats = {1.23: 1000, 3.1415: 10000, 2.71: 100000}
mixed = {"string": 1, 10210: 2, 4.97: 3, False: 4}


# Check lhs value is == rhs value
print([2, 4, 6] == [2, 4, 6])
# OutPut:- True

print([2, 4, 6] == [6, 4, 2])
# OutPut:- False

# Compair Two diff dictionary has same key & value ?
first = {0: 2.1, 1: 2.2, 2: 2.3, 3: 2.4}
second = {2: 2.3, 0: 2.1, 3: 2.4, 1: 2.2}

print(first == second)
# OutPut:- True . How its True ? Bcz, They Don't need to see in sequnce ordered are not. THey only need to see that is there are key & value both are mathched / same or not.



# Check whethere a key in is really exists within a dictionary.

# Use "in" and "not in" operators.

first = {0: 2.1, 1: 2.2, 2: 2.3, 3: 2.4}
print(key_name "in or not in operator" "var_name")

print(0 in first)
# OutPut:- True

print(1 not in first)
# OutPut:- False
